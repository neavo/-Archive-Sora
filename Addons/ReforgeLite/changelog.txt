   M /trunk/ReforgeLite.lua
   M /trunk/ReforgeLite.toc

** v1.05
   M /trunk/ReforgeEngine.lua

** v1.04
   M /trunk/Presets.lua
   M /trunk/ReforgeEngine.lua
   M /trunk/ReforgeLite.lua
   M /trunk/ReforgeLite.toc

- Fixed and improved spirit-to-hit option. It now automatically detects spirit-to-hit talents, and only allows using one stat cap.
- Output window now uses checkboxes, so users can select which items they want to skip reforging. Also, irrelevant reforges aren't
 applied.
- Reforging is now a bit faster and makes a lot less noise, but users shouldn't interfere in the process, otherwise results are
 unpredictable.

   M /trunk/GUI.lua
   M /trunk/Localization.lua
   A /trunk/Presets.lua
